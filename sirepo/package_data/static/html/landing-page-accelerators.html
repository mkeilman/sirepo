            <div class="lp-info-panel-content-header"><a href="#/elegant">elegant</a></div>
            <p>elegant simulates charged particle accelerators with a wide range of features, including support for nonlinear optimization and design. It is supported by Argonne National Lab (ANL) and is used most often for electron linacs and synchrotrons.</p>
            <div class="lp-info-panel-content-header"><a href="#/warppba">Warp</a></div>
            <p>Warp simulates high-intensity electron and ion beams and plasmas, via both electrostatic and electromagnetic PIC. It is supported by Lawrence Berkeley Lab (LBL) and Lawrence Livermore Lab (LLNL).</p>
            <div class="lp-info-panel-content-header"><a href="#/synergia">Synergia</a></div>
            <p>Synergia simulates charged particle accelerators with 3D space charge and impedance-driven wake fields. It is primarily supported by Fermi National Acceleator Lab (Fermilab) and is most often used for proton linacs and rings.</p>
            <div class="lp-info-panel-content-header"><a href="#/opal">OPAL</a></div>
            <p>OPAL is a framework for charged-particle optics in accelerator structures and beam lines with 3D space charge. It is primarily supported by the Paul Scherrer Institute (PSI).</p>
            <div class="lp-info-panel-content-header"><a href="#/rslinac">RsLinac</a></div>
            <p>RsLinac provides specialized reduced algorithms for rapid (up to 1000x faster than CST Particle Studio) simulation of traveling wave electron linacs with beamloading. It is supported by RadiaBeam Technologies and by RadiaSoft.</p>
            <div class="lp-info-panel-content-header"><a href="#/zgoubi">Zgoubi</a></div>
            <p>The computer code zgoubi calculates trajectories of charged particles in beam lines, rings, cyclotrons, etc., comprised of magnetic and electric fields. It includes spin, synchrotron radiation, in-flight decay, several Monte Carlo procedures.</p>
